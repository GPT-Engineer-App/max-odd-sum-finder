Maximum odd sum


I need a function that should find the highest possible sum of two numbers that, when added together, form an odd number.

Create an input and a button to add the numbers to check the max odd sum.

Assume that the array contains between 1 and 150 000 elements and that each element is within the range of 1 to 1 500 000.

Examples:

[19, 2, 42, 18] should return 61
[61, 32, 51] should return 93
